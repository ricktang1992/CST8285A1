                        Databases are used to store data and are a core component of many information technology systems.
                        Students learn the fundamentals of relational databases design using Entity Relation Diagrams (ERDs) and
                        use
                        Structured Query Language (SQL) to create, modify and query a database. Students design and create
                        databases that
                        are maintainable, secure, and adaptable to change in business requirements, using normalization.

                        The study of algebraic and transcendental functions is an essential prerequisite to Calculus.
                        Students manipulate algebraic expressions, solve algebraic equations and linear systems, and learn the
                        properties of
                        and graph algebraic and transcendental functions. Students investigate computer number systems in
                        addition to
                        Boolean algebra and logic to help solve problems involving computer systems.

                        Communication remains an essential skill sought by employers, regardless of discipline or field
                        of study. Using a practical, vocation-oriented approach, students focus on meeting the requirements of
                        effective
                        communication. Through a combination of lectures, exercises, and independent learning, students practise
                        writing,
                        speaking, reading, listening, locating and documenting information and using technology to communicate

                        The World Wide Web (WWW) has become an integrated part of everyday life. Students develop basic skills of web
                        programming, website design and implementation. JavaScript, HTML5, and PHP are used to explore web-based solutions to
                        problems of increasing interactivity and complexity. Lectures are reinforced by practical assignments that encourage
                        students to construct and maintain their own websites.

                        Working in the field of information technology as a programmer requires a firm understanding of Object-Oriented
                        Programming (OOP) concepts. Students explore object-oriented programming methodology using the Java programming
                        language. Object oriented concepts, such as encapsulation, inheritance, abstraction and polymorphism are covered and
                        reinforced with practical applications.

                        software. Students explore the basic concepts and components of Operating Systems (OS), and how they function and
                        interact with hardware and software components. Students examine the details of operating system structures, process
                        management, storage management, installation, configuration, and administration both in theory and through practical
                        assignments based on the GNU/Linux operating system.
